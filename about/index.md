Zheng Xu, born in 1992 in Wuhu, Anhui, China. 

# Education

At present I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.uta.edu/), [University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.uta.edu/) supervised by [Junzhou Huang](http://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/). I was graduated from Department of Mathematics and Statistics, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn/) in June, 2014. From 2007 to 2010, I was also educated in [Wuhu No.1 High School](http://www.wuhuyizhong.com/).

# Technical Interests

My technical interests are generally three-folds, web backend development, network theory and low-level techniques(computer architecture and operating system). 


## Web Backend Development

My first glance at web development is that when I was in 6th grade(12 years old?) in primary, I occasionally met a free ASP hosting ad. It led me to write my first basic register-login ASP script. It's tough but interesting.

After I entered university, in a crawler project group led by [Liang Zhou](http://zhouliang.pro), I was asked to write a check-in board PHP website to manage our groups' attendance. Thanks to Zhou, I learned PHP in just one afternoon. After that, I even wrote a client for that check-in board in Python. And in that project, I learned many crawler basics like XPath, XML, etc.

You may ask why I only mention backend and what happened to web frontend. My answer will be 'I suck at visual design' and that's true. See my recent work ['helminth'](https://xericzephyr.github.com/helminth/) as a proof. :(  You are welcome to help my CSS design in helminth and your kindly help will be greatly appreciated.

## Network Theory

Since the network environment in China mainland is so complicated, it's necessary for me to learn some special things, e.g. internet freedom methodology. So I learned many protocols like TCP, HTTP, PPTP and so on. Due to the strict restrictions in China mainland, I will not articulate them all. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me through email or IM tools(e.g. gtalk). 

## Low-level Techniques

In senior high school, I was quite interested in software reverse engineering which, I suppose, is an alternate name of binary code analysis. Many of my previous related work could be found on [my Baidu Space](http://hi.baidu.com/xuzheng1111). It's not updated now. And in the future I may transfer some of my old work here.

In my undergraduate life, I joined two projects related to low-level(system-level) techniques. One is related to Mac OS X kernel. I was assigned to write a general x86/x64 inline hook engine on Mac OS X. Actually it requires more knowledge about x86/x64 processor instruction set. The other one is about windows kernel-mode development (or windows driver development).
