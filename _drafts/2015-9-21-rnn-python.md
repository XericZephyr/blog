	A relatively complete survey in recent progress in applying RNN to different applications. 

## Contributions 

	In the last week, my contributions are generally with Python coding. I become aware of a very powerful tool called with statement in Python. Moreover, I refrained several of my old Python code using with-statment. The result is very pleasing. 
	
## Miscelleneous

	Last but not least, I learned several other important things last week.
